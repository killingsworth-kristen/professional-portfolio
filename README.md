# professional-portfolio
This is the place that all of my professional materials are housed. 

## Installation
There is no installation necessary and the application has been deployed at this address: https://killingsworth-kristen.github.io/professional-portfolio/.

## Usage
At the top of the page there is a nav bar that is linked to the relevant sections of the webpage (about, projects, experience, and resume). The last link on the nav bar links directly to a pdf of my resume. This is optimized for mobile viewing and condenses down into a hamburger menu. 

I have provided my final project for my coding bootcamp, a weather dashboard app, and a social media network API as examples of my work. All of them have a link to the code hosted on Github as well as the app/demo. Additionaly, I have a section about what I am currently developing that will be constantly updated with links to the files on github. 

The experience section utilizes Bootstrap's list group and collapse components to creat an interactive look at my work history. All of the information is also available on my resume. 

The footer has links to my github, linkedIn, email, and phone number.
