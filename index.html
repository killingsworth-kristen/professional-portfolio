        <p class="row">Hello! My name is Kristen Killingsworth and I am a fledgling full stack web developer. My background and bachelor's degree is in Humanities specifically focused on the societal issues surrounding marginalized communities. My original intention was to enter the field of museology however due to the pandemic it was difficult to build the connections required of breaking into that field. I fell back on my previous work experience of working with children to become an RBT working with children diagnosed with Autism. In 2022, I decided that I wanted to make a career change and enrolled in a full stack coding bootcamp through the University of Washington.</p>
        <p class="row">During my bootcamp, I learned many skills involved with full stack web development. During my course work for my bachelor's I participated in a  
          <a href="https://cdm16786.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16786coll12/search/searchterm/xxskillspire" target="_blank">research project</a> to document and archive materials from a local organization targeted for under served populations in our community. I was assigned to Skillspire which is an organization that focuses on helping women and people of color gain employment in the ever expanding tech industry. This was part of my inspiration for choosing to attend a bootcamp and I hope to apply my newly acquired skills and my life experiences to bring a unique and necessary perspective to any development team.</p>
